**Welcome** to my blog!

My name is Mr Visneski, I am an aspiring coder hoping to learn the basics of coding.

I have been learning to code on FreeCodeCamp.com for the past few weeks and so far have completed 385 of 1409 coding challenges and 1 out of 30 projects.

I'm hoping to learn coding in my free time beginning with the basics of HTML, Javascript and CSS.
