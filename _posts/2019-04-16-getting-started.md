**Welcome** to my blog!

My name is Mr Visneski, I am an aspiring coder hoping to learn the basics of coding.

I have been learning to code on FreeCodeCamp.com for the past few weeks and so far have completed 385 of 1409 coding challenges and 1 out of 30 projects.

I'm hoping to learn coding in my free time beginning with the basics of HTML, Javascript and CSS.

I have previously had a **little bit** of experience with coding with **Java** back in 2012 when I was 15 with coding plugins for Minecraft servers. Since then in the past 5 years I had forgotten pretty much everything I had learnt back then. 

My old github can be found [here.](www.github.com/McLuke300/)

In 2019 I decided to have a go at **coding** again and have decided to try and work through the course at [FreeCodeCamp.com](https://freecodecamp.org)
